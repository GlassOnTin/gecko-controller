# TI ISO1640 vs ISO1540 Comparison

## ISO1640 Advantages
- **Bidirectional, automatic direction sensing** (no direction pin needed)
- **Lower power consumption** (~1.5mA per channel vs 2.3mA)
- **Supports clock stretching** (important for some sensors)
- **Wide supply range**: 2.25V to 5.5V both sides
- **2500 VRMS isolation** (same as ISO1540)
- **Better for multi-master** I2C setups

## ISO1540 Advantages
- **Slightly higher speed** (up to 2 MHz vs 1.7 MHz)
- **Simpler pinout** (fewer pins)
- **Slightly cheaper** (~$1 less)

## Pololu I2C Isolator Carrier Board Advantages

The Pololu board (#2595) with ISO1640 is **PERFECT** for your gecko controller:

### Key Features:
1. **Isolated Power Supply Built-in**
   - Provides isolated 5V or 3.3V to your sensors
   - This means relay switching can't cause power supply noise to sensors
   - Worth the extra cost alone!

2. **Complete Integration**
   - Pull-up resistors included (10kΩ, can add stronger ones)
   - Proper PCB layout for noise immunity
   - Level shifting capability (3.3V Pi to 5V sensors if needed)

3. **Plug-and-Play**
   - 0.1" header pins
   - Clear labeling
   - No SMD soldering required

### Wiring for Your Setup:
```
Raspberry Pi Side          Pololu ISO1640         Isolated Side
(Clean Power)              Board                  (Potentially Noisy)
-----------------          --------------         ------------------
3.3V ─────────────────→ VDD1                    
GND ──────────────────→ GND1                    
SDA (GPIO 2) ─────────→ SDA1                    
SCL (GPIO 3) ─────────→ SCL1                    
                                                 VISO → All 4 devices VCC
                                                 GNDI → All 4 devices GND
                                                 SDA2 → All 4 devices SDA  
                                                 SCL2 → All 4 devices SCL
```

## Why This Solves Your Relay Problem:

1. **Galvanic Isolation**: Complete electrical isolation between Pi and sensors
2. **Power Isolation**: Relay switching can't cause voltage dips on sensor power
3. **Ground Loop Prevention**: No ground path for EMI to travel
4. **Bidirectional**: Works with all your I2C devices transparently

## Cost Analysis:
- Pololu ISO1640 board: ~$15-20
- vs buying components separately:
  - ISO1640 chip: $6-8
  - Isolated DC-DC converter: $5-10
  - PCB and components: $5
  - Your time soldering: Priceless

## Installation:
```bash
# No software changes needed!
# After wiring, test with:
i2cdetect -y 1

# All 4 devices should still appear:
# 0x3C - OLED Display
# 0x44 - SHT31 Sensor
# 0x68 - Unknown device
# 0x74 - LED/Multiplexer
```

## Additional EMI Hardening:
Even with the isolator, consider:
1. Add 100nF ceramic capacitors near each relay coil
2. Use twisted pair or shielded cable for I2C lines longer than 10cm
3. Keep relay power wires away from I2C wiring
4. Add ferrite beads on relay power lines

## Summary:
The Pololu ISO1640 board is **ideal** for your application because:
- ✅ Solves relay EMI issues completely
- ✅ Includes isolated power (huge benefit!)
- ✅ No software changes needed
- ✅ Protects all 4 I2C devices with one board
- ✅ Professional PCB design better than DIY
- ✅ Worth the ~$20 investment to prevent lockups
